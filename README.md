# DS Assignment 3 ‚Äì Council Election using Paxos

## Overview
This project implements a **single-decree Paxos consensus algorithm** to simulate the election of a ‚ÄúCouncil President‚Äù among 9 distributed members (M1‚ÄìM9).  
Each member can act as a **Proposer**, **Acceptor**, and **Learner**, communicating via **TCP sockets**.

The system demonstrates consensus formation under:
- Ideal network conditions
- Concurrent proposals
- Fault-tolerant scenarios (latency, failure)

## Manual Compilation (Optional)

If you prefer to compile and run the program manually instead of using the provided script:

### Step 1 ‚Äî Compile
From the project root directory:
```bash
javac -d out src/CouncilMember.java
```
This will compile the source file into the `out/` directory.

> The `-d out` flag creates a separate folder for compiled `.class` files, keeping the workspace clean.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äî Run a Single Member
For example, start **Member M1** in a reliable profile with a proposal:
```bash
java -cp out CouncilMember M1 --profile reliable --propose M5 --propose-delay 200
```

You can run multiple members (M1‚ÄìM9) in separate terminals using different profiles from `network.config`.

Example:
```bash
java -cp out CouncilMember M2 --profile latent
java -cp out CouncilMember M3 --profile failing
```

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî Observe Output
Each process will print messages such as:
```
[M1][16:45:58] PROPOSE start n=1.1 v=M5
[M2][16:45:58] LEARN CONSENSUS: M5 has been elected Council President!
```

Once a majority accepts the proposal, **all members will output the consensus**.

---

## Running the Tests

### Step 1 ‚Äì Compile and Run All Scenarios Automatically
```bash
bash run_tests.sh
```

The script automatically:
- Compiles the source
- Cleans old logs and processes
- Runs the 3 required test scenarios

---

## Scenarios and Expected Outcomes

### **Scenario 1: Ideal Network**
- **Setup:** All 9 members use the `reliable` profile.
- **Test:** One member (e.g., M4) proposes M5 for president.
- **Expected:** All members agree ‚Äî *M5 has been elected Council President!*

---

### **Scenario 2: Concurrent Proposals**
- **Setup:** All 9 members use `reliable` profile.
- **Test:** Two members propose simultaneously (M1‚ÜíM1, M8‚ÜíM8).
- **Expected:** The Paxos algorithm resolves conflict; one single consensus is reached (e.g., *M1*).

---

### **Scenario 3: Fault Tolerance**
- **Setup:**
    - M1 ‚Üí reliable
    - M2 ‚Üí latent (slow)
    - M3 ‚Üí failing (drops messages)
    - M4‚ÄìM9 ‚Üí standard
- **Test:** M2, M3, M4 trigger proposals with delays.
- **Expected:** Despite failures and latency, the system reaches consensus (e.g., *M5*).

---

## Example Output

```
=== Scenario 1: Ideal Network ===
CONSENSUS: M5 has been elected Council President!

=== Scenario 2: Concurrent Proposals ===
CONSENSUS: M1 has been elected Council President!

=== Scenario 3: Fault Tolerance ===
CONSENSUS: M5 has been elected Council President!
```

Logs for each scenario are stored under:
```
logs-s1/
logs-s2/
logs-s3/
```

## Fault Recovery & Automation

`run_tests.sh` automatically:
- Kills leftover Java processes (both `CouncilMember` and `java.exe`)
- Cleans up `.pid` files
- Recreates the log directories
- Launches members with proper profiles and delays
- Detects when consensus is achieved

---

## Code Quality & Documentation

- All methods in `CouncilMember.java` follow **Javadoc-style** documentation.
- Code follows **high cohesion & low coupling** principles.
- Variable and method names are **clear and descriptive**.
- No ‚Äúmagic numbers‚Äù; constants are defined at the top of the class.
